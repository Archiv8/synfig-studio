## Package Options

**Should options be altered from the original, and a problem occur, the resulting issue will not be given a high priority**

The following has been taken from _./configure --help=short_

Configuration of Extended Template Library 1.3.12:

### Optional Features:

\-\-disable-option-checking                                   ignore unrecognized \-\-enable/\-\-with options
\-\-disable-FEATURE                                           do not include FEATURE (same as \-\-enable-FEATURE=no)
\-\-enable-FEATURE&#91;=ARG&#93;                              include FEATURE &#91;ARG=yes&#93;
\-\-enable-silent-rules                                       less verbose build output (undo: "make V=1")
\-\-disable-silent-rules                                      verbose build output (undo: "make V=0")
\-\-enable-maintainer-mode                                    enable make rules and dependencies not useful (and sometimes confusing) to the casual installer
\-\-enable-dependency-tracking                                do not reject slow dependency extractors
\-\-disable-dependency-tracking                               speeds up one-time build
\-\-enable-warnings=&#91;none|minimum|maximum|hardcore&#93;   Control compiler pickiness.  &#91;default=maximum&#93;
\-\-enable-optimization=&#91;0,1,2,3,4&#93;                   Select optimization level (default=2)
\-\-enable-debug                                              Build in debugging mode
\-\-enable-profiling                                          Enable profiling using gprof

### Some influential environment variables:

CXX         C++ compiler command
CXXFLAGS    C++ compiler flags
LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L\<lib dir\> if you have libraries in a
nonstandard directory \<lib dir\>
LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l\<library\>
CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I\<include dir\> if
you have headers in a nonstandard directory \<include dir\>
CXXCPP      C++ preprocessor
CC          C compiler command
CFLAGS      C compiler flags

Use these variables to override the choices made by 'configure' or to help
it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.
