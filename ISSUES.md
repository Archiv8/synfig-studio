Only an issue based around the packaging of Synfig ETL will receive a response.  This includes bugs, feature requests, todos etc, within the PKGBUILD or other files hosted in this repository.

Should you discover an issue please:

1. Take steps to ensure it is an issue with the packaging and not the upstream sources.
1. Take a look at the catalogue of issues provided in this file. These are summaries with direct links to the specific issue pages.
1. Search repository's [issue pages][a8-issue-url] for similar issues both active and inactive
1. If you can find nothing that relates to the issue you are experiencing create a [new one][a8-issue-url] using the templates provided, when available.  This will help speed up the process of triaging and producing a fix.
